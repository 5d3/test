Well you know one thing i think is that this is going to lead to more inflation, and when you think about inflation that ends up helping debtors, because that leads to less amount that they're going to have to pay at a nominal value in actual dollar terms right but this is ultimately going to hurt many people that are in lower incomes they their wages typically don't rise at the same rate as inflation and so, this will mean that their real wage the amount that they can actually buy of goods and services will go down and so while at the same time that the Biden administration talks about income inequality his very policies will put more a rising income inequality across the country and this is an unfortunate scenario that can be overcome we know what happened during the Trump administration when you cut taxes you provided deregulation放宽管制. What happened, the lowest poverty on record, the highest real real median household中产家庭 income on record that's what we need to get back to pro-growth促增长 policies not anti-growth anti-jobs and anti-family policies by the Biden administration.",

I'm sure there's not going to be credit for time lost unfortunately, because the Constitution itself sets the date for inauguration, but he should definitely get the remainder of his term and and make the best of it.",
