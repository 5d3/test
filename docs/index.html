<h1 class="head1">It's all gone to HEVEL without Jesus</h1>
<p>
Jesus took our place under hevel so we could live a life of meaning, security, and absolute love before the eternal Father.
</p>

<p>
A God bigger than the hevel, A GOD WENT THROUGH HEVEL so you could know security and happiness through him.
