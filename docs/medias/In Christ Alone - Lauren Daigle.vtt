"In Christ Alone"

00:12.840 --> 00:15.760
In Christ Alone

00:15.760 --> 00:18.260
my hope is found

00:18.660 --> 00:23.700
He is my light, my strength, my song

00:23.700 --> 00:28.920
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground

00:29.120 --> 00:34.400
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

00:34.520 --> 00:40.060
What heights of love, what depths of peace

00:40.140 --> 00:45.400
When fears are stilled, when striving cease

00:45.400 --> 00:51.120
My Comforter, my All in All

00:51.120 --> 00:56.020
Here in the love of Christ I stand

01:05.440 --> 01:11.420
There in the ground His body lay

01:11.540 --> 01:16.400
Light of the world by darkness slain

01:16.400 --> 01:22.000
Then bursting forth in glorious Day

01:22.140 --> 01:27.520
Oh, up from the grave He rose again

01:27.640 --> 01:32.780
And as He stands in victory

01:32.860 --> 01:37.980
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me

01:38.240 --> 01:43.840
For I am His and He is mine

01:44.020 --> 01:49.120
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

01:59.520 --> 02:05.160
No guilt in life, no fear in death

02:05.260 --> 02:10.320
This is the power of Christ in me

02:10.400 --> 02:20.960
From life's first cry to final breath, Jesus commands my destiny

02:21.160 --> 02:26.400
No power of hell, no scheme of man

02:26.580 --> 02:31.960
Can ever pluck me from His hands

02:31.960 --> 02:37.700
Till He returns, or calls me home

02:37.800 --> 02:42.980
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

02:43.200 --> 02:49.120
Till He returns, or calls me home

02:49.320 --> 02:55.280
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

02:55.280 --> 02:57.280
