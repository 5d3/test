Your pacemaker's here, the techs are programming it as we speak.

00:03.480 --> 00:04.940
The moment they're ready, we're gonna put it in.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.740
I told you

00:19.440 --> 00:20.800
my wife died.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.460
The truth is...

00:24.280 --> 00:25.840
she left me.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.320
But I gave her good reason for that.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.400
so I got what I deserved.

00:35.020 --> 00:38.100
- We all make...  - But you didn't get what you deserved.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.680
...good parents who loved you.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.240
They were lucky to have you, Jared.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.240
