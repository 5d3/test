Dear Edward, I've gone back and forth the last few days trying to decide whether or not I should even write this.
亲爱的爱德华 这几日我一直在犹豫究竟该不该把我想说的写下来

00:10.080 --> 00:17.520
In the end, I realized I would regret it if I didn't, so here goes.
最后我想 如果不写 我一定会后悔, 所以才有了这封信

I know the last time we saw each other, we weren't exactly hitting the sweetest notes.
记得你我最后一次相见, 可以说是不欢而散

00:24.260 --> 00:27.020
It certainly wasn't the way I wanted the trip to end.
以如此的方式收场 当然不是我的本意

00:29.500 --> 00:34.320
I suppose I'm responsible, and for that I'm sorry.
这事儿责任在我 在此我说声抱歉

00:35.860 --> 00:39.100
But, in all honesty, if I had the chance, I'd do it again.
但说实话 如果再给我一次机会 我还是会做出相同的决定

00:44.040 --> 00:47.500
Virginia said I left a stranger, and came back a husband.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.440
I owe that to you.
关于这一点 我欠你的情

00:52.920 --> 00:56.000
There's no way I can repay you for all you've done for me...
你为我做的一切 我无以回报

00:56.800 --> 01:01.660
so rather than try, I'm just going to ask you to do something else for me.
既然如此 我索性直接开口 求你再为我做一件事

01:03.360 --> 01:05.380
Find the joy in your life.

01:08.060 --> 01:10.400

你曾经说过 你并非普通人

01:10.600 --> 01:12.580

You're certainly not everyone.

My pastor always says:
我的牧师总说

01:25.380 --> 01:28.260
"Our lives are streams...
"我们的生命就像小溪…

01:28.540 --> 01:30.540
flowing into the same river...
最后汇入同一条大河…

01:30.660 --> 01:34.520
towards whatever heaven lies in the mist beyond the falls."
大河尽头的瀑布之上 在迷雾后若隐若现的 就是天堂

01:35.060 --> 01:38.560
