00:02.180 --> 00:04.280
There are no shortcuts.

00:04.280 --> 00:06.520
There are no hacks应付差事.

00:06.520 --> 00:12.220
If you want to take the easy road, I promise
you: it’s longer and more painful

00:12.220 --> 00:13.720
than the hard road.

00:13.720 --> 00:14.940
I know.

00:14.940 --> 00:16.190
I’ve lived it.

00:16.190 --> 00:23.009
I’ve ventured冒险 down the easy road at times
in my life and it never led to anywhere good.

00:23.009 --> 00:28.320
The positive things in my life always came
when I faced the biggest challenges.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.779
I joined the Navy海军.

00:29.780 --> 00:33.960
I took the hard road in the Navy and made
it into the SEAL Teams海豹突击队.

00:33.960 --> 00:38.240
There, I had the honor of leading men in combat.

00:38.240 --> 00:43.360
I learned some lessons along the way, lessons
that have been tested on the battlefield and,

00:43.360 --> 00:47.420
when implemented, lead to success in any arena竞技场，舞台.

00:47.420 --> 00:53.080
One of the best things I’ve learned is that
anyone has what it takes to travel the hard

00:53.080 --> 00:57.640
road—to walk The Path that leads to success.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.840
That includes you.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.920
It won’t be easy.

01:01.920 --> 01:05.160
It will demand everything you’ve got to
give.

01:05.170 --> 01:11.260
But you can do it, and I want to give you
three key principles I’ve learned that will

01:11.260 --> 01:13.460
help you to get it done.

01:13.460 --> 01:17.820
Principle原则 number one: Discipline. Equals. Freedom.

01:17.820 --> 01:20.920
That’s not a contradiction矛盾—it’s an equation等式.

01:20.920 --> 01:24.600
Discipline might appear to be the opposite对立面
of freedom.

01:24.600 --> 01:28.340
But, in fact, discipline is the path to freedom.

01:28.340 --> 01:31.960
Discipline is the driver of daily execution.

01:31.960 --> 01:36.780
Discipline defeats the infinite无数的 excuses借口 that
hold you back.

01:36.780 --> 01:41.840
Some people think motivation积极性，动机 is what will
compel迫使 them to get things done.

01:41.840 --> 01:48.180
But motivation is just an emotion—a feeling,
and like all feelings, it’s fickle浮躁的，易变的:

01:48.180 --> 01:49.920
it comes and goes.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.460
You can’t count on motivation to be there
when you need to get through

01:54.460 --> 01:57.220
truly challenging times.

01:57.220 --> 01:59.800
But you can count on discipline.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.780
Discipline is something you dictate支配，命令.

02:02.780 --> 02:07.360
Motivation won’t make you exercise every
day; discipline will.

02:07.360 --> 02:12.920
Motivation won’t stay up熬夜 late and finish
a project for you; discipline will.

02:12.920 --> 02:18.440
Motivation isn’t going to get you out of
bed in the morning; discipline will.

02:18.440 --> 02:25.600
Make discipline part of your daily life and
your daily life will get better.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.320
Principle Number Two: Stay. Humble.

02:29.320 --> 02:33.980
In life, you are going to have to do things
that you don’t want to do.

02:33.980 --> 02:40.840
Maybe things that you don’t think you should
have to do—things that offend冒犯，使...不愉快 your precious ego自我，自负.

02:40.840 --> 02:45.300
When I got done with Basic SEAL Training and
reported on board SEAL Team One,

02:45.310 --> 02:47.220
you know what I was assigned to do?

02:47.220 --> 02:49.740
I was assigned to clean toilets.

02:49.740 --> 02:54.360
That’s right—despite having just graduated
some of the most difficult military training

02:54.370 --> 02:59.220
in the world, despite being assigned to an
“elite精英” commando突击队 unit—my first mission

02:59.220 --> 03:03.300
at the actual SEAL Team was to clean toilets.

03:03.300 --> 03:06.580
Not exactly a glorious job.

03:06.580 --> 03:08.300
But you know what?

03:08.300 --> 03:09.300
I did it.

03:09.300 --> 03:14.160
I did it to the best of my ability and took
pride in doing it well.

03:14.160 --> 03:19.490
And that attitude态度 got noticed: if I cared
that much about how clean the toilets were,

03:19.490 --> 03:23.400
people knew I would do a good job with even
more important assignments.

03:23.400 --> 03:27.960
After a short period of time, I got those
more important assignments.

03:27.960 --> 03:31.460
But it was humility谦卑，谦逊 that opened the door for
me.

03:31.460 --> 03:36.640
Now, being humble does not mean that you shouldn’t
be confident.

03:36.640 --> 03:40.600
You certainly have to believe that you are
a capable有能力的 person.

03:40.600 --> 03:44.260
But don’t let confidence turn into arrogance自大；傲慢态度.

03:44.270 --> 03:47.780
So keep your ego in check and stay humble.
（in check受控制的）

03:47.780 --> 03:53.080
The third and final principle: Take. Ownership. Of. Everything.
（ownership n. 所有权；物主身份）

03:53.120 --> 03:56.520
I call this “Extreme极度的 Ownership.”

03:56.520 --> 04:01.620
In the military, the best leaders and the
best troops were the ones that took ownership

04:01.620 --> 04:06.380
of everything in their world—not just the
things they were responsible for, but for

04:06.380 --> 04:10.580
every challenge and obstacle障碍 that impacted
their mission.

04:10.580 --> 04:15.900
When something went wrong: They cast投掷，抛 no blame,
they made no excuses.

04:15.900 --> 04:19.279
They took ownership of the problem and fixed it.

04:19.279 --> 04:25.080
You can implement this attitude as well—not
only in your job, but in your life.

04:25.080 --> 04:29.720
Let other people blame their parents, their
boss, or the system.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.520
Let weaker people complain that the world
isn’t fair.

04:33.520 --> 04:39.220
You are the leader of your life: take ownership
of everything in it.

04:39.220 --> 04:43.120
So: be disciplined in all that you do.

04:43.120 --> 04:47.260
Don’t subject臣服 yourself to the whims虚妄 of motivation.

04:47.260 --> 04:51.360
Stay humble and be willing to do what needs
to be done.

04:51.360 --> 04:56.760
And: take extreme ownership of your life and
everything in it.

04:56.770 --> 05:04.229
Then: choose the hard path—the path of responsibility,
hard work, and sacrifice奉献，牺牲.

05:04.229 --> 05:11.840
The Path of discipline, humility, and ownership
that ultimately最终 leads to freedom.

05:11.840 --> 05:17.540
If you follow these principles, then nothing
in the world will stop you.
