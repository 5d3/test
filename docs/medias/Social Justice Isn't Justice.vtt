00:02.340 --> 00:08.630
The Lord is a God of social justice.
That’s the message in many—maybe most—churches

00:08.630 --> 00:14.140
and synagogues in America and the West today.
But here’s the problem: The Bible doesn’t

00:14.140 --> 00:20.500
actually say that. It says (in Isaiah), “The
Lord is a God of justice公正.” You’ll find

00:20.510 --> 00:25.230
a lot of references to justice in the Bible.
But you’ll never find it preceded被放置在前面的 by the

00:25.230 --> 00:29.230
word “social.”
But you’re probably thinking, “What’s

00:29.230 --> 00:35.580
the difference? Isn’t God the God of justice
and social justice?” Well, not if He’s

00:35.580 --> 00:42.040
consistent一致的. You see, God cannot be the God
of justice and social justice because social

00:42.040 --> 00:46.980
justice is not just公正的.
Justice is getting what you deserve应得，配得 without

00:46.980 --> 00:53.240
favor. Social justice is getting what you
don’t deserve because you are favored受到优待的.

00:53.300 --> 01:01.180
Justice is blind. Social justice is not.
Let's say a man robs a store. Justice demands

01:01.180 --> 01:07.399
but one thing: that he be tried审判 in a court
of justice, and, if he is found guilty, punished.

01:07.399 --> 01:12.630
That is not how social justice works. Social
justice doesn’t only ask if the person is

01:12.630 --> 01:19.170
guilty. It asks about his economic condition:
Is he poor or wealthy? About his upbringing养育，抚养:

01:19.170 --> 01:24.289
What kind of childhood did he have? About
his race or ethnicity: Is he a member of a

01:24.289 --> 01:29.619
group that has been historically oppressed压迫，折磨?
Justice demands that everyone be equal under

01:29.619 --> 01:36.799
the law. Social justice demands that everyone
be equal. Period. Economically, socially,

01:36.800 --> 01:42.860
and in every other possible way.
Justice asks, “Who did it?” Social justice

01:42.860 --> 01:50.280
asks, “Why did he do it?”
Lost in all these social justice considerations

01:50.289 --> 01:55.840
is the individual’s own responsibility for
what he did. That’s why social justice advocates拥护者

01:55.840 --> 02:01.979
have abandoned the term “justice.” They
deem认为 justice alone as unfair. And sometimes

02:01.979 --> 02:07.439
it is. A man who was beaten by his father
and abandoned by his mother is more likely

02:07.439 --> 02:12.920
to commit犯下 a violent crime than a man raised
in a loving home. But those facts cannot and

02:12.920 --> 02:19.860
should not determine判定 his innocence or guilt.
Why? Because justice is, first and foremost最先的，最重要的,

02:19.860 --> 02:25.780
about truth: Is the person guilty or innocent
of the crime? None of us is omniscient无所不知的. We

02:25.780 --> 02:31.230
don’t know why people do what they do. After
all, the vast大量的 majority of people raised in

02:31.230 --> 02:36.579
abusive homes do not commit violent crimes.
Nor do the vast majority of people who are

02:36.579 --> 02:42.849
members of an historically oppressed group.
Being a victim, however that is defined, is

02:42.849 --> 02:48.299
no excuse for hurting other people. And what
about those who are hurt—the victims of

02:48.299 --> 02:53.969
those crimes? Shouldn’t they, and other
law-abiding守法的 citizens公民, be society’s first

02:53.969 --> 02:59.180
consideration?
Social justice advocates say no. They say

02:59.180 --> 03:04.629
we need social justice to even things out.
And that means favoring偏袒，有利于 the have-nots贫民 over

03:04.629 --> 03:10.560
the haves—the poor over the rich, the female
over the male, and the brown or black over

03:10.560 --> 03:14.150
the white.
The Bible does not see the world this way.

03:14.150 --> 03:17.790
In fact, it speaks against it in very explicit明确的，清楚的
terms.

03:17.790 --> 03:22.970
Here’s a law in the Book of Exodus出埃及记: “Do
not pervert歪曲，颠倒 justice by siding with站在...一边 the crowd,

03:22.970 --> 03:26.620
and do not show favoritism偏袒 to a poor person
in a lawsuit.”

03:26.660 --> 03:32.500
Here’s one in Leviticus利未记: “Do not pervert
justice; do not show partiality偏心 to the poor

03:32.500 --> 03:36.480
or favoritism to the great but judge your
neighbor justly.”

03:36.480 --> 03:42.660
Moses, the greatest lawgiver in history, declares
in Deuteronomy申命记: “Follow justice and justice

03:42.670 --> 03:45.400
alone.”
And the New Testament约 declares in the Book

03:45.400 --> 03:51.040
of Romans: “God shows no partiality.”
None of this means that there is no place

03:51.040 --> 03:56.549
for compassion in a system of justice. Of
course, there is. The Bible is preoccupied全神贯注的

03:56.549 --> 04:03.360
with the protection of the widow, the orphan,
and unfortunate不幸的. But compassion follows justice.

04:03.360 --> 04:08.680
It doesn’t precede it.
Also, justice, in and of itself, is compassionate.

04:08.689 --> 04:13.751
First, to the victims受害者 of crime and to their
loved ones. And second, to the criminal: How

04:13.751 --> 04:17.480
can you become a better human being if you
don’t first recognize that you’ve done

04:17.480 --> 04:20.959
something wrong?
That’s why any time we put an adjective形容词

04:20.959 --> 04:27.199
before the word “justice,” we no longer
have justice. Economic justice, racial justice,

04:27.200 --> 04:33.120
environmental justice—any form of “social”
justice which seeks to “correct” actual

04:33.120 --> 04:39.300
justice—undermines破坏，暗中破坏 justice.
So, then, if social justice is not a biblical

04:39.300 --> 04:43.960
concept, why do so many churches and synagogues犹太教会堂
promote it?

04:43.960 --> 04:49.740
Because many Christians and Jews no longer
regard biblical principles as binding有约束力的. Because

04:49.740 --> 04:54.710
it’s a lot easier to dispense分发 compassion同情，怜悯
than hold people to a biblical standard. And

04:54.710 --> 05:00.750
because leftism has superseded取代 the Bible in
many houses of worship—and leftism, as a

05:00.750 --> 05:05.250
guiding principle, holds that the weak are
good and the powerful are bad.

05:05.250 --> 05:10.250
That’s why the great battle of our time
is between Judeo-Christian犹太教与基督教 values and leftist

05:10.250 --> 05:15.980
values. The former is rooted in justice; the
latter is not.
