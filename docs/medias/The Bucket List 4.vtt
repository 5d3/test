I'm sorry if this sounds terrible, but...
抱歉 我这么问可能没教养，但是…

00:04.800 --> 00:10.280
aren't you a little developed in years to be running up a giant mountain?
您这年纪去爬大山 是不是太成熟了点？

00:10.660 --> 00:14.680
"Developed," now that's certainly one way of putting it.
"成熟" 这说法倒蛮合适的

00:15.000 --> 00:17.840
Well, I've been up there, you know. - Really? - Mm-hm.
那什么 我倒是上去过。  - 真的啊？- 嗯

I made it to 26,000 feet before we had to turn back.

But at night, you've never seen so many stars.

Seems like they're just out of reach, and so bright.

- Did you hear it? - Hear what?
- 那你听见了没有？- 听见什么？

01:05.800 --> 01:09.340
I read an account of a man who made it to the summit...
我读过一本登顶者写的书

01:10.320 --> 01:14.160
and standing there at the top of the world...

01:28.280 --> 01:30.520
The sound of the mountain.

01:32.680 --> 01:36.060
He said it was like he heard the voice of God.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.880
I've never done this before.
我以前从没这么做过

01:46.640 --> 01:49.660
That sounds like such a cliche, but...
这话听上去很老套 但是…

01:51.660 --> 01:55.500
but I have a room upstairs.
